If you have a class which is a base class but it basically serve as a skeleton for a purpose for the derived classes
That is Ingredient class is useful for us to have it as it defines things common for any
kind of ingredient. So, basically you should not be able to create the object of Ingredient itself.
So it is better to make that class abstract.

Abstract classes can not be instantiated.

They only serve as the base classes for other, more concrete types. You can define it using "abstract" keyword.

access_modifier abstract class ClassName
{

}

Note that base class can also be still used as a general type.
