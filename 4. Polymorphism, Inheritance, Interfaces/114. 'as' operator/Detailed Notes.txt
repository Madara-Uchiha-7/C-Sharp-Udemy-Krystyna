"as" Operator can be used In the down Casting or Explicit Casting.

DerivedClassName derivedClassVariableName = GeneralTypeName as DerivedClassName;

If you're using this operator then exception will not come and result will simply be null. 
While if you decide to go with other syntax then exception will come. 

If you're using this operator then make sure to add the null checks.
