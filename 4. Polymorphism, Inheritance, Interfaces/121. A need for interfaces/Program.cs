// Lets us say there is a class AnimalKingdom
// The Dog and Duck both are child of this AnimalKingdom.
// But Duck are also birds, so we want this Duck class also be the child of the
// Bird class. So that it could inhrerit those properties and methods.
// But we can not do this using Inheritence but interface will help.
