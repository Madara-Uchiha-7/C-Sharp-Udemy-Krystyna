1. You can assign null to the types. 

2. You cannot use NULL with var keyword. 

3. You can check if type is null or not as follows:
objName != null 
or 
object is not null

4. If someone overload the != operator then we cannot use it like point 3. 
We cannot overload "is not" operator. 

5. Not all types can be assigned null. For example int, Numbers, boolean and DateTime. 
They have their own default values.
