// The class can not derive directly from more than one base class.
// That is more than one parent is not allowed in the inheritence. Because 
// lets say the method with same name and structure is present in the both parent classes and
// child is calling that method the C# engine can not understand which one to call.
// In last lecture the class Mozzarella is deriving from 2 classes i.e. Cheese and Ingredient.
// The hierarchy is linear that is Mozzarella -> Cheese -> Ingredient
// It is possible in some languages like C++.
