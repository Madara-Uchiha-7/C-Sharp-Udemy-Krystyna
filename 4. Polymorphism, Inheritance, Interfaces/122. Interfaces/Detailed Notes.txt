1. Interfaces are used to define a base type for the types exposing methods with same signature.

2. We use interface for those classes which does not share the is-a relationship but share the same behaviour.

3. Prefix with Letter I is the naming convention.

4. In interfaces we only declare methods not the body of methods
and each type implementing the interface will have the override them.

5. When overriding the method in the child class,
signature i.e. type, paramaters etc should be same as Interface methods.

6. overrided methods in the child class has to be public.

7. Methods defined in the interface are always implicitely virtual. So dont add virtual keyword manually here.

8. Interfaces can not be instantiated. They are too abstract for that.

9. we can use interface as the General Types as we did for inheritance

10. The C# 8 : added a feature called default implemenations in interfaces. It is considered as the bad change or addition by many C# devs.
