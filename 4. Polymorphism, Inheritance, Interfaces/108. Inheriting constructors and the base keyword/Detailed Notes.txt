1. A default constructor is generated only when parameterized Constructor is not created. 

2. If you create the object of derived class or you create the object of general type which points to the derived class 
then the constructor of the parent class that is base class will be called before the child class constructor. 

3. Point to will cause the error if base class has the parameterized constructor. 
Code is in the Program.cs

You need to pass the arguments of the constructor of the base class while creating the 
new ChildClass()

You need to create the minimum number of parameters in the derived class constructor which we can pass to the base class constructor.
