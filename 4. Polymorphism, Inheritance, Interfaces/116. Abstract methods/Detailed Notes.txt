1. Abstract methods can be defined only in the abstract classes.

access_modifier abstract type methodname();

2. These methods does not have the implemenatations.

3. That is their bodies are empty, so there will be no {} and there will be ; after ()

4.  All the abstract methods are implicitly virtual. So adding virtual keyword will cause error.

5. We must have to override these methods in all child non-abstract classes.

6. We can skip the overriding of the abstract method if the child class is also abstract.


Note:
I added non abstract method in the abstract class that is a method with the implementation without the abstract keyword
and virtual keyword.
Then I got the compilation error in the derived classes. 
To remove this error I added the same method which I added in the base class Without the override keyboard.
