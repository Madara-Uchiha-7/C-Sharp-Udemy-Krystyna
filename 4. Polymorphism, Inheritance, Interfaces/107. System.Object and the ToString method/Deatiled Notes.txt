All the classes are derived from System.Object type.
So that we can access ToString() and GetType()

Console.WriteLine(CustomClassObjectName);

This will print the name of the class. 
Because WriteLine Method takes the object as the argument 
And in that logic it uses ToString() method.

We can override this ToString method.
