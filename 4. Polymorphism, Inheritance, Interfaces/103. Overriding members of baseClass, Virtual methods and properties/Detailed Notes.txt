1. Base class object can point to the derived class object. 
BaseClassName objectName = new DerivedClassName();  

Here objectName will be called as the General Type.

2. If you want to access the derived class properties using the general type, then:
    1. Same property should be present in the base class. 

    2. You need to make base class property virtual. 
       Virtual tells the compiler that this property may get overridden in the derived class. 
      
      Syntax : access_modifier virtual type propertyName

    3. Add override keyword to that property in the derived class. We can skip this keyword. 
      If we do so, then general type will use the base class property even if it has a virtual keyword present. 

      Syntax : access_modifier override type propertyName

3. Point two applies for the methods also. 

4. We cannot have the virtual fields.
