1. String class is a sealed class.

2. Lets say there is a class which does not have one method which you need to add it
in that class.
But what if ther class is from Standard Library or some open source library.
Here we have 2 choices:
    1. We can create own class derived from the class you want to extend.
    and add the method. But their is a possibility that the parent class is sealed. 
    2. Extension methods allows us to seemingly add methods to an existing
    type without modifying this type's source code.

3. Extension methods can only be defined in static classes.

4. Extension method itself must have to static.

5. It is a good practice to have a seperate class for each extended type. 

public static class TypeNameExtensions
{
    public static return_type MethodName(this TypeInWhichYouWantToAddThisExtentionMethod input) => 
        input.Split(Environment.NewLine).Length;
}

TypeInWhichYouWantToAddThisExtentionMethod: If you add a string, then it becomes the extension method for string type.

The parameter of the extended type must always be the first parameter. 
So if you want to add more parameters then they must be after it.
