///
/// Abstract methods - Shapes
/// The purpose of the exercise is to make the GetShapesAreas method work.
/// This method takes a collection of Shapes, and 
/// returns a collection of their areas as doubles.
/// A Shape's area is a double number, so a floating-point numeric type. 
/// For example, we can use doubles like this:
/// double someNumber = 10.05;
/// Your task is to:
/// Add the abstract Shape class in such a way that it can be used in the 
/// GetShapesAreas method.
/// Finish the implementations of the Square, Rectangle, and Circle classes 
/// so that each has the CalculateArea method that can be used in GetShapesAreas method.
/// To calculate the area of a circle, we will need the PI number. 
/// We can access it using the Math.PI constant.
