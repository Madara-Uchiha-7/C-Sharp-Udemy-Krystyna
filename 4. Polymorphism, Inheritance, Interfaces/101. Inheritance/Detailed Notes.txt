1. A class whose members are inherited is called base class. 
2. A class that inherits those members is called derived class. 

class Ingredient
{

}
class Pizza : Ingredient
{

}
class Sandwich : Ingredient
{

}

Ingredient is a base class.

Pizza and Sandwich are derived classes.

Pizza is a Ingredient.
Sandwich is a Ingredient. 

So, this shows us that inheritence is a "is a" relationship.
