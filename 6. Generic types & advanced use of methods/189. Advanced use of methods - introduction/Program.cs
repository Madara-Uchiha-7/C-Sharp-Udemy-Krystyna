/// 
/// We will investigate the advanced use of methods, specifically how the methods
/// can be stored in variables, passed as parameters etc.
/// 
/// We will also learn about very interesting generic types which are Funcs and Actions.
/// 
/// All this knowledge will not only be helpful in the rest of this section and its final assignment, but
/// also in the next section in which we will learn about LINQ. (I have bought teachers linq course
/// so I will be completing that instead of completing the linq section.)
/// LINQ library relies on using methods as parameters to other methods quite a lot.
/// So understanding those concepts will be critical for understanding LINQ.
/// 
/// We will be able to write and read modern, efficient and sophisticated C# code.
