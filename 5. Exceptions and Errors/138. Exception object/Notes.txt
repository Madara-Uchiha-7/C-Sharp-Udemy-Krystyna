1. There are 3 main types of erros
    1. Compilation error
    2. Runtime error : E.g. divide by 0
    3. Logical error : Program does not crash but also does not work.

2. In C# the runtime errors are called as Exceptions.

3. Exceptions are also objects.

4. They can also be container for the data.

5. All exceptions are derived from System.Exception base class.
   This means there are differnet types of Exceptions and all of them are derived from System.Exception base class.

6. We can also create our own exceptions by creating class which will derive the System.Exception.

7. If you click on view details on given Exception by C#, it will open the
   quick watch window.
   Once the quick watch window opens, you will see many options there:
   1. Message: This property has the most information.
   2. InnerException: Sometimes stores another exception object which is nested in main exception.
   3. stack strace: In the bottom we have the method that is called first.
        Then another methods may come which are being called
        So, basically it stores the stack like structure, which shows us from start to end that 
        The on top comes the exception, it means the method before that is the place where that error came.
        It is better to handle the exceptions otherwise if not then Program will crash.
