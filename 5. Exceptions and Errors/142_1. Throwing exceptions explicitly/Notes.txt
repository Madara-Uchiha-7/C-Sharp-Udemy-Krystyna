1. Make sure to throw the exceptions only when it is imp.

2. The exception should contain the details of error neatly which will help the dev what to check.
   i.e. pass the good message while throwing the Exception from the code.
   e.g. throw new Exception("Invalid year of birth.");

3. We can also throw different types of Exceptions. 
   e.g. throw new InvalidArgumentException("Invalid year of birth.");

4. Syntax is mentioned in the point 2 example.

5. We can save : new Exception("Message" + ex.Message);
   this in the varibale and then throw the varibale.
   This is possible because the Exception is the class and using the new keyword we are creating the object of it.
