1. Always think twice before creating a custom exception.
   Perhaps there is already an exception that we can use.
   Ask yourself that would it really carry any more information than the predefined exception.
   If we created custom exceptions for wrong situations, our code would soon bloat to an enormous size.

2. You'll have a developer team working with you. 
   So if you define the custom exception then the other developers may not know about it. 
   They will expect that you will throw the predefined exception. 
   Some developers does not have the access to all the code.
   Also if they do have the access, still they will have to go and check your custom exception which again takes more time. 

3. When programming, we should follow the principle of least surprise.
   It says that the code should behave in a way that most users will expect it to behave.
