1. Exception filters are the conditions which we add in our catch block.
   So, if the code in the catch is supposed to be executed then 
   catch block type should match and the catch Exception filter should be true.

   Syntax:
   catch (type ex) when (condition on ex parameter)
   e.g.
   catch (HttpRequestException ex) when (ex.Message.StartsWith("4"))

2. It is sometimes the case that the code inside the try block might throw exceptions that are all
   of the same type and only differ by the values of properties.
   In this case you can use Exception filters feature.
