1. If the assumptions a method operates on are not met, it is fine to throw an exception
   because it is a situation when a developer made a mistake that needs to be fixed.

2. Method should only handle an exception using catch when it can do it in a reasonable way.
   If it can't, the exception should not be caught at all or it should be rethrown.

3. Add a global try-catch block that can catch an exception not caught elsewhere and then shut the application down gracefully.

4. A global try-catch block is a special place where catching the System.Exception is fine.
   It should surround the entry point of the application.
   Entry point is the first method that is called which also calls other methods.
   In the console application it is the main method in the program class.
