1. Make sure your method only does that part which it shows in its signature. 
   If your method signature does not show everything, that is if your method does something else or 
   something additional other than what your method signature is, 
   then every time other developer will have to come and will have to check that method, what it does and what its working is. 

2. By "exception as hidden part of method" means that our method signature does not show if our method has exceptions defined 
   or not. Or if they are defined then we don't know which of them are defined. 
   So every time other developers will have to come and check them.
