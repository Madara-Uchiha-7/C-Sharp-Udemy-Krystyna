/// CSV stands for Comma Separated Values.                 
/// It is a file format that stores data in a tabular form.
///                  
/// Each row represents a record and each column represents a field within that record.
/// We can open CSV files with many programs, including Excel, Google Sheets or WPS Office.
/// 
/// 
/// Since CSV is a textual format, we can also open it in a notepad.
/// Each line represents a row except for the first one in which column names are listed.
/// Each cell in a row is separated from others with commas.
/// 
/// Many companies still store huge amounts of data in spreadsheets,
/// not in actual databases.
/// They do it because spreadsheets are easy to use and understand by everyone, even without technical
/// knowledge.
/// 
/// Also, such data can be manipulated with Excel.
/// 
/// If a company has stored its data in spreadsheets since 1998, it might struggle with migrating it to
/// modern databases.
/// 
/// The bottom line is that there is a big chance that one day you will have an opportunity to work with CSV files.
