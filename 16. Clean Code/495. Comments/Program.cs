/// We will talk about comments and why it is usually best to avoid them.
/// The code with many comments is the one that is bad.
/// If the code is hard to understand, commenting on it is not the solution.
/// Refactoring is.
/// 
/// If your variable or a method is named so badly that a comment is needed to explain its meaning, it
/// must be renamed.
/// 
/// If it is so complex that it requires a comment explaining what it does, it must be refactored.
/// 
/// First of all, comments get outdated very fast.
