We will learn what mistakes may lead to the fall of a software project.
We will also understand what the Definition of Done(DoD) is.

The company we discussed in the previous video made a couple of mistakes.
The first one was assuming that in each new release, the team could deliver the same number of functionalities.
This is not realistic.
The first weeks of working on a new project are always special.

There is nothing to maintain yet, so the work progresses quickly.
But this happy state cannot last.

Without clean up and refactoring, the productivity of programmers within a project
decreases over time.

Each change takes more time, so in practice, it is more expensive.

That's why keeping the quality high and refactoring the code regularly is so important.

The next mistake this company made was assuming that delivering the software that works means the job
on a feature is done.

A working code and a high-quality code are two very different things.

That's why it is crucial to define a definition of done.
Often shortened as DOD.

It is a set of criteria that must be met for a task to be considered complete.
Each company has its own definition of done, or at least they should have.
Some of the most common criteria are the following.
The code must be unit tested, reviewed by at least two other developers and merged into the common
code repository.

DOD may be more extensive and, for example, include integration and end-to-end tests and a documentation
update. 

Only once all requirements included in the definition of done are met
do we consider the work on a given task finished. When respecting the definition of done
we prevent quality degradation as we simply don't consider the job finished until it is done right.

A third mistake the company made was allowing the tech debt to grow.
Let's discuss tech debt in more detail in the next lecture.
