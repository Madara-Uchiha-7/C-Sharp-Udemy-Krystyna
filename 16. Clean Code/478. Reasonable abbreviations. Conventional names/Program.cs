/// Let's now discuss situations when using abbreviations may be acceptable.
/// We also talk about conventions in naming.
/// Generally speaking, using abbreviations is acceptable when there is zero chance of misunderstanding
/// And when we know that developers will immediately know their meaning.
/// Typically, this refers to situations when a certain abbreviated name follows a widely recognized convention.
/// For example, consider a try-catch block.
/// It is conventional to name the exception object we catch "ex".
/// 
/// Of course, there is nothing wrong in using the full name exception.
/// Still, it is so typical to name this object "ex" that there is no chance this will be misinterpreted.
/// 
/// A person reading this code will understand the purpose of this variable without any extra effort.
/// 
/// Let's see another example of a very short name that programmers immediately recognize and understand.
/// It is the index in a for loop.
/// It is conventional to call it "i".
/// So even if it is an abbreviation, using it is fine.
/// Everyone with just a little programming experience knows what "i" in a loop is and there is no chance
/// of misunderstanding.
/// 
/// For example, consider an Add method which simply adds two numbers.
/// Naming those parameters A and B is a good idea because anyone who ever learned math is used to this
/// convention of naming operands.
