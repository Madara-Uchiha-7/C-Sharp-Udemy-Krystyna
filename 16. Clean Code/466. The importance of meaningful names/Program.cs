///
/// We will discuss the importance of meaningful names.
/// When programming, we name things all the time.
/// 
/// We name variables, methods, parameters, classes, files, and so on.
/// When reading the code and remember, we do it more often than we write it,
/// we mostly read names that the developers of this code came up with.
/// 
/// Good names are the foundation of clean and readable code.
/// We should always think hard about them and make sure the names we use are the best we can come up with.
/// 
/// It should be enough to read the method signature, and then we already know what it does.
/// 
/// Finding good names is hard.
/// Even experienced programmers struggle with that.
/// Naming things well requires a lot of effort.
/// No matter how experienced we are.
/// 
/// But for this effort, we will be rewarded with clean and easy-to-understand code that we can quickly
/// grasp, even if we read it a year after writing it.
/// Spending time thinking about names will save us more time in the long run because we'll be able to read
/// and understand the code much faster.
