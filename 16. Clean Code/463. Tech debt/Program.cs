We will understand what tech debt is.
Tech debt refers to the accumulated consequences of allowing bad quality in software development,
which may require future rework or refactoring.

It is similar to financial debt.
We borrow some money so our lives are easier for now, but we will need to pay it back sooner or later.
The later we do it, the higher the interests are.

If we refuse to pay it for a long time, we may even become financially ruined as the interests will
become higher than what we can earn.

It is the same with tech debt.

We allow bad quality, as in the short run,
it makes our lives easier as we can deliver features faster.
But sooner or later we must pay this debt and refactor the code.

The later we do it, the more costly it will be.

It may even turn out that if we do it very late, the debt will be so huge that we will not be able
to keep delivering any new functionality and for some time we will be forced to only work on fixing
the old code.

Rushing the development and allowing the tech debt to grow has one more consequence.
It misleads the management and the customer by giving them a false sense of how fast the work will progress
in the future.

They will think we can always deliver at the same pace and they will plan the deadlines accordingly.
But keeping those deadlines will not be possible because sooner or later, the tech debt will need to
be paid and the code refactored, which may consume a lot of time, a time during which we will not
deliver new features.But once a deadline is set, there will be pressure on the developers to meet it.
They will be overloaded with work and there will be no time for refactoring.
This will make the tech debt grow even more, and digging out of it in the future will become even harder
and more time consuming.
Later equals never, says the LeBlanc law.
Of course, sometimes it is impractical to drop everything and start an extensive refactoring right
when we think it is needed.
But once a need for refactoring is noticed, doing it should be planned and we should find time for
it as soon as possible.
This will keep the tech debt at a reasonable size and save us from future troubles.

One may think, "but this is the management's fault.
The developers wanted to do the refactoring, but they were forced to continue working on new features."
Well, this is not 100% true.
Let's talk more about it in the following lecture.
