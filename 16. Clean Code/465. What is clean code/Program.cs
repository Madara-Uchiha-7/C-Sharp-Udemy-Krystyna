/// We talked about the importance of clean code.
/// There are a couple of ways of measuring it.
/// 
/// Let's start with one that seems like a joke, but in fact, it may be the best quality indicator of
/// them all.
/// 
/// The cleanliness of code can be expressed in WTFs per minute i.e. WTF / per minute
/// 
/// If the code is good, someone reading it barely ever says WTF.
/// 
/// But when the code is not clean, things look quite different.
/// 
/// Another interesting thing about developing software is that we spend more time maintaining the code
/// than creating new one.
/// 
/// Maintaining means things like fixing bugs, altering the existing functionalities or refactoring.
/// This means a code of high quality should be easy to maintain. In such code
/// when a change needs to be introduced, it is easy to find a place we will need to work on.
/// There will be only one place that needs to be modified.
/// In other words, the logic is not duplicated.
/// The change will be easy to implement and will have little chance of breaking other functionalities.
/// 
/// So we said that clean code is simple to read and understand and its maintainance is easy.
/// When we look for an implementation of some specific functionality, it is easy to find.
/// Clean code is also not over complicated or tricky.
/// 
/// There is no one right way to create clean code.
/// 
/// We can have two programs that look quite different, but they both do the same thing and both are of
/// high quality.
/// 
/// It is worth experimenting with different approaches and finding the one best for us.
/// 
/// Clean code may take years to master, and even experienced developers don't create perfect code.
///
