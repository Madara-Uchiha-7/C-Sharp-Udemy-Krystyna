/// We will discuss how we, the developers, should handle communication with the project
/// management regarding the quality of the code.
/// 
/// It is tempting to assume that all problems related to low quality are the fault of the project management
/// and not the developers.
/// 
/// After all, it is the management who presses the devs to deliver the code quickly, as this is simply
/// better for business; the faster the team finishes the work on the program, the faster they can start
/// working on another one and the company will make more money.
/// 
/// But we must understand that it is we, the developers, who best understand the consequences of bad
/// quality.
/// 
/// It is our job to communicate them clearly to the project management and ensure they understand it too.
/// It is not an easy task.
/// 
/// After all, the project managers are often people with no technical background.
/// If we fail to do so, it will be bad for everyone.
/// 
/// If the management is smart, they will understand that bad quality leads to slower development and that
/// slower development means less money made.
/// Of course, the management is not always smart and they sometimes make bad decisions, but it is not
/// an excuse for us to not be professional.
