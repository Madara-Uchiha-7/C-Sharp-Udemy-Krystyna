Story about a certain software company.
Although this company is fictional, it draws inspiration from real life counterparts.
The company gets a new customer who needs a certain program to be created.
The team of developers is built and everyone is excited to start the work on this brand new project.
The developers start coding and the first version of the app is soon ready.
The client is delighted and can't wait for the new releases.
They are also impressed by how quickly this version 0.1 has been delivered.
The quality is also great.
The code is fully covered with unit tests and there are no bugs at all.
Integration and end-to-end tests are included, and they check thoroughly if the app works as expected.
More and more code is added every day.
Single classes grow into whole class hierarchies and become much larger than before.
The code that once was simple becomes complicated.
The developers start to discuss the need for refactoring, but version 0.2 needs to be released soon.
They decide that refactoring can wait a bit.
The new release is also a success.
Although a couple of minor bugs are noticed during the demo.
Nevertheless, the customer is pleased and can't wait for the new features to be added.
The team starts to work on version 0.3.
The agreement with the customer is to add 10 new features in this release, but the work no longer
goes as quickly as when the team first started to code.
Each new change takes more work.
The design becomes tangled and complicated.
The team planned to do some refactoring, but it is clear now there will be no time for that.
The deadline is getting closer and there is still much work to be done.
The developers talk with the management and tell them that rushing with new code is not a good idea.
The work should be stopped.
The code refactored and the tests extended, but the management doesn't want to hear about it.
The company used to deliver 10 new features with each new release.
So how can they tell the customer that the new release will only contain bug fixes?
Why is the client supposed to pay for that?
