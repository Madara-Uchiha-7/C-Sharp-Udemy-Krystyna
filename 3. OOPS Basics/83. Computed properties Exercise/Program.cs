/*
InitialState, representing the sum of money in the account at the beginning of the day
SumOfOperations, representing the total of incomes and outcomes from the account.
So, for example, we can have an account that had 2000$ (or other currency)
at the beginning of the day, and the sum of operations for this account and
day is -200$. This means, at the end of the day, there is 1800$ in the account.
/*
Add two public computed properties to this class:
EndOfDayState, returning the sum of InitialState and SumOfOperations
Report, returning a string in the following format:
"Day: 15, month: 3, year: 2025, initial state: 2000, end of day state: 1800". 
Day, month, and year shall be taken from the current date. 
The initial state and end of day state shall match what is stored in the object.
