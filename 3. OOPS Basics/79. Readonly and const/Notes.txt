Const:
 
1. This can be assigned to the variable/ fields
2. It can be done at declaration and they must be given a compile time constant value
3. They can not be modified afterwords.
4. With const you can not use var keyword 
5. Names of const fields or variables should always start from the capital letter

readonly
1. can be assigned at the declaration
2. Making field readonly makes it immutable
3. It is fine to if value is evaluated at runtime for readonly
4. Since it is not compulsory to assign them a values while declaration
we can give them the value in construtor, i.e. while creating the object.
Once that is done, we can assign them a new value.
