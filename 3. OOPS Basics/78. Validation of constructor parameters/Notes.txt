1. nameof is the operator not the method.

2. It returns the name of a variable, type or member as a string literal, without hardcoding it.

string myVariable = "Hello";
Console.WriteLine(nameof(myVariable));  
Output: "myVariable"


This makes refactoring safer â€” if you rename the variable in code, the nameof result updates automatically.

3. Works with classes, properties, methods, namespaces, fields

4. If you pass something invalid, you get a compile-time error, making it safer than using string literals.


Commonly used in:

Exception parameter names
