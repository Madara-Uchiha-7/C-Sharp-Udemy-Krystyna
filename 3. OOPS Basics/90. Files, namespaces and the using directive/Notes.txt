1. 
There will be always a possibility that you will create multiple class files in the same project. 
Those class files can be present in the multiple or different folders in the same project. 
And their will be one main class which will use all these folders or all these other classes.

To access those different multiple classes from different folders you have to use something called :
"using" directives in the main class.

Synatx:

using namespace;


2. 
In above point we mention namespace in the Synatx.
These namespaces will be mentioned on the top of those multiple classes Which will be present in different folders.

Synatx of these namespace or convension of these namespaces.

First: 
namespace folderName.className
{
    class className
    {

    }
}

Second:
namespace folderName.className;
className
{

}

3. For each class there will be one file.
   More than one file can be present in one folder.
   The same class name will used as the file name and namespace name.

4. We can have nested namespaces.

5. Having each class in seperate file is generally a good practice.

6. We should always have one file for one class in production code.

7. We can also have the nested namespaces.

8. We can rename the namespace.
