1. If the field name and parameter name is same
then we can do 
this.fieldName so that compiler will know that we are pointing to 
current class field and not the parameter.

2. Also if you want to pass the current class object to the method as the parameter
from the current class 
then you can simply pass "this" keyword. It will pass the current instence of the class.
