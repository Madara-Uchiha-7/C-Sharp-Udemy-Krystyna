Sometimes we have namespaces that we use over and over again in almost every file of the project.
Instead of writing the using directive for this namespace in each file, we can import it globally for
the entire project.

Let's say there is one namespace we want to use which is called ABC. 
This name especially want to use in ten files.

Then in only on file you write:

global using ABC.className;


This way you can use this namespace in all other nine files. 
You don't need to write 
using ABC.className; 
in each of those nine files.

This global using directive is available from the C# 10.

When you create any new class file, there will be few namespaces which are included using the "using" directive. 
These name species are graded out.
This means that even if we remove those namespaces, we can still use them in our class. 
But how come we can use them even if we're not using the "using" directive? 

Go to 
FileExplorer -> project -> bin -> Debug -> net8.0 ->
Here you will find ProjectName.GlobalUsings.g.cs

Why there is a word g in above file name:
Convention : The files which are auto generated and not created by the programmers, has g in the name.

In these files there will be a global namespaces which are added using the "using" directive. 
Henceforth, even if those namespaces are not included in our class, we can still use them. 
You can also add your own namespace which you want to be a global namespace in this file.

This file gets compiled with the rest of the project.
