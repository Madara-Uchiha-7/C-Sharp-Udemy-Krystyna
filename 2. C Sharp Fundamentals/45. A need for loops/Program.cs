/// We will learn what loops are and what they are useful for.
/// We will also see what kinds of loops we can define in C#.
/// Loops allow us to execute pieces of code multiple times.
/// 
/// In C#, we have a couple of types of loops.
/// while and do while loops that allow us to execute some code repeatedly
/// as long as some condition is met.
/// 
/// for loop, which is most often used to execute a loop a given number of
/// times.
/// 
/// Finally, we will speak of the foreach loop, which runs some piece of code for each element of a collection.
/// 
/// Loops and collections are tightly related.
