/// We will learn what the most important skill of any programmer is.
/// We will also see what to do when our programs don't work as expected.
/// 
/// Finally, we will find out what StackOverflow is.
/// For now, our program works correctly, but it will not always be so.
/// We, as programmers, make errors and mistakes, and it is entirely normal, even for very experienced developers.
/// 
/// But once our code is not valid, the compiler will no longer be able to understand it and translate
/// it.
/// 
/// In other words, the compilation will fail, no executable will be built and will not be able to run
/// our application.
/// 
/// We can see an error in the error list tab.
/// 
/// It's pretty straightforward, and we could probably be able to figure out what to do to fix this error
/// without even looking for the answer online, but it will not always be the case.
/// 
/// Sometimes the errors are more complicated or about topics we know nothing about.
/// In this case, we'll need to pull up our sleeves and try to google the solution.
/// And this is it.
/// 
/// The most important skill of any programmer is to find the solution online to our code issue.
///
/// If you work on your own project or as a developer in some company, you will have to be able to search
/// for answers online by yourself.
/// And also, I must say it is quite a satisfaction to find a solution to a nasty bug or error.
/// 
/// In 99% of the cases when you will be googling some issue, the first or second result will be Stack
/// Overflow. Stack Overflow is the largest Q&A website for programmers in the world.
/// Usually it is a great place to look for answers and explanations.
