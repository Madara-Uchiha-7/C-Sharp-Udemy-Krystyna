/// We will learn how to add more than one project to a solution and how to switch between
/// them.
/// 
/// You probably have a C# project opened in Visual Studio where you practice all the mechanisms we
/// learn.
/// 
/// Please notice that this project belongs to a solution with the "2. C Sharp Fundamentals" name.
/// A solution is simply a collection of projects.
/// 
/// We can add more than 1 project in 1 solution.
/// To do so, we can right click on the solution.
/// And select Add New Project.
/// This is the same window we saw before where we could select the project template.
/// In our case it will be a console application.
/// 
/// To make the new project run when we click on run button, we must right click on the project
/// we want to run, and select Set as Startup Project.
/// 
/// If we want to go back to the first project we must simply select it as the startup project.
///
/// 
/// In Visual Studio Code
/// adding a new project is very simple.
/// 
/// While having a solution opened, we must simply create a new project and it will be automatically added
/// to this solution.
/// For this:
/// Click on top search bar:
/// Select Show and Run commands and then choose ".NET: New project".
/// Give the name.
/// 
/// A neat feature of Visual Studio Code is that the run button always builds and runs the project associated
/// with the currently opened file.
/// This means that to switch between projects being run, you simply need to switch between the open files.
/// 
/// 
/// -----------------
/// We can't use the "operator" keyword as the name of the parameter because this keyword is reserved in
/// C#.
/// We can bypass this limitation by adding the @ symbol before the variable name or parameter name.
/// 
/// We can use ToUpper method to make the string uppercase.
/// 
/// stringVariableName.ToUpper()
///
