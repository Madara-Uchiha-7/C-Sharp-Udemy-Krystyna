/// String represents, well, a string of characters.
/// We must put the characters into single quotes like this.
/// 'A'
/// When using chars in the C# code, we must always put them into single quotes.
/// If we put them into double quotes, we will actually use strings even if they are as short as a single
/// letters.
///

/// Keep in mind that chars can represent any single character, not only a letter.
