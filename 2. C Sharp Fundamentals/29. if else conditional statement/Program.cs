/// We will learn about crucial, Building blocks for our code:
/// The if/else, conditional statements.
/// 
/// It's a very common use case that we want to execute some piece of code if some condition is true and
/// another if it is false.
/// 
/// Syntax:
/// if (condition) {// if true then run this piece of code}
/// else {// if false then run this piece of code}
/// 
/// We can only write if statement. 
/// if (condition) {// run this code}
/// 
/// We can make the ladder like:
/// if (condition)
/// {// run this code}
/// else if (condition)
/// {// run this code}
/// else if (condition)
/// {// run this code}
/// else {// run this code}   // This else is not compulsary.
/// 
/// In this ladder first maching condition block will be executed.
/// If you skip the else {} and no other conditions on the top returns true then
/// no code blocks in if-else ladder will be executed.
/// 
/// 
/// 
/// stringVariableName.Length will give us the length of the string.
/// Length is the property name here.
/// We access properties by writing a dot right after the name of a variable and then the property name.
