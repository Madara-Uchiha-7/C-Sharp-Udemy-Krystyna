/// We will learn what exceptions are.

/// But id user enters the string instead of integer, then int.Prase will throw the error.

/// "System.FormatException: Input string was not in a correct format."
/// 
/// This is the first, but definitely not the last exception we see.
/// Exceptions are the C# way of representing runtime errors.
/// 
/// If there is an issue that the application can't manage
/// an exception is thrown.
/// 
/// If it is not handled anyhow, the application will crash, which happened right here.
/// In other words, it will not be able to continue.
