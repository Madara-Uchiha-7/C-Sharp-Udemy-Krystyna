/// We will learn about yet another C# type: the bool.
/// We will also learn a bunch of new operators.
/// So far we have learned about two types: ints, which represent whole numbers and strings which represent
/// text.
/// 
/// bool is the simplest type in C#, and it can only take two values:
/// true or false.
/// 
/// The equality operator : ==
/// We use it to check if something is equal to something else.
/// It gives true if equal otherwise false.
/// 
/// As you can stop the running application, you can also restart it using the 
/// restart button besides the stop button. Both of these buttons will appear when
/// we run the application.
/// 
/// 
/// We can use the inequality operator like this:
/// value1 != value2
/// It wors in the oppsite way of == operator.
/// 
/// Alternatively, we can use the logical negation operator which negates any boolean value:
/// !(value1 == value2)
/// 
/// ! works in the same way as !=
/// 
/// <, >, <= and >=
/// are the greater than, less than, greater than equal to and less than equal to 
/// operators. We can use them with numbers
/// i.e. e.g. number1 <= number2
/// They also returns the true and false.
///
