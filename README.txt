1. You may see that, after lecture n, next lecture number is n + 3 instead of 
   n + 1. This is because teacher keeps adding new videos in between if needed. Which changes the 
   numbers on Udemy. But I have covered all the concepts which are needed.

2. Sometimes if you see that some lecture number is skipped then it is because I may have added the code changes in
   of skipped lecture n into the lecture n - 1. 
   Or
   That lecture is not that important to add the code.

3. N.A. for now. 


Section 2 
Some lectures comments you need to fix, they do not explain everything.
IF possible write section 2 assignment also.

Section 3,
starting 2-4 lectures does not have the notes file. Add it.
